# Global Instructions

## Problem Solving
- Before proposing a solution, research the industry-standard approach to the problem and use it to inform your recommendation

## Writing Style
- Avoid using emdashes in writing
- Avoid using hyphens or dashes as conjunctions (use commas/semi-colons or rewrite)

## Documentation Style
- Be concise; engineers scan, they don't read novels
- Prefer examples over prose
- Assume technical competence, skip obvious explanations
- Front-load critical info (warnings, key concepts first)
- Default to 1-2 sentence explanations; only expand when complexity requires it

## Commits
- Never add the AI agent as a commit author or co-author
- Always commit using the default git settings
